Welcome to **Senju**, an automation project designed for farming utilities.




## Overview

Senju is a collection of utilities, including ESP32 code and backend server components, designed to automate various aspects of farm management. This project emphasizes cost-efficiency and reusability, making it accessible for small-scale farmers and DIY enthusiasts.

Repository is structured as different code utilities. Documentation will be focused on how to combine these utilities to specific workflows.

## Goals

- **Cost-Effective**: Built with affordable hardware and cloud services
- **Reliable**: Reliable for Indian scenarios. There are quite a lot of challenges from irregular power supply to weather conditions
- **Observable**: Measure what you want to improve. Project priotises observability more than automation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with Senju, you will need:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Sensors (e.g., soil moisture, temperature)
- A server to run the backend (Raspberry Pi, local server, or cloud instance)
- Basic knowledge of electronics and programming

## Use cases

### Measuring soil moisture
